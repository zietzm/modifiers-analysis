    "2. remove repeats e.g., pain and painful are both found in the criteria_string \"... painful ...\". \n",
    "   To avoid biasing our gold standard we remove these \"repeats\"\n",
    "3. remove criteria_string that are less than 200 characters in length due to an indexing error\n",

    "3. ignore parent concepts that include the three modifiers of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we create a dataset of notes for annotation that follow the criteria below\n",
    "1. parent concepts included must have at least 10 instances where a criteria_string includes a modifier\n",
    "2. For each parent concept, we choose 5 instances with a modifier and 5 without a modifier (10 total per parent)\n",
