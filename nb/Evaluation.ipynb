    "## Annotation Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on ShARe guidelines, when annotating a note, the following workflow seems to bring the most reliable annotation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify all disorder spans in the note  \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Assign each disorder a SNOMED ID  \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Annotate each disorder's severity modifier  \n",
    "\n",

    "  \n",

    "### Example  \n",
    "The patient presented with severe pre-eclempsia  \n",
    "The disorder “severe pre-eclempsia” has the modifier Severity associated with the span “severe” and mapped to “Severe”.\n",

    "The patient presented with tiny gallstones.  \n",
    "The disorder “gallstones” has no Severity modifier. The word “tiny” is a qualitative modifier, and mapping it to a severity would require medical inference."
